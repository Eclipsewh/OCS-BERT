# Fine-tuning
Please run CodeBert0506.ipynb for fine-tuning first, followed by importing model parameters in detectNEW.ipynb for testing.

Please adjust the parameters according to your own dataset size and resources. Only if the parameters are within a reasonable interval, you can have better results
